# Formsender add-on for Vaadin

Simple add-on to allow doing HTTP POST calls from the client-side. See [the Directory](http://vaadin.com/addon/formsender) for more info.

To test, clone the repo, run *gradlew demo:vaadinRun* and browse to *http://localhost:8080/app*. From there you can do a HTTP POST to either the app itself or a separate JSP page.
